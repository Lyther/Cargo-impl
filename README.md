# Cargo-impl
Innovation project. Use Cargo system to dynamically arrange the bus time schedule, and measure how well it is.

Be aware:
Done lists and todo lists should be put in the root folder Document/
If you face any questions, raise an issue
Let's play with Cargo!

File structure:
- Bus-digital-twin: our project file, with some useful tools and API. The usage of tools can be found in README.md in Tools/ folder.
	But currently, it seems that position of bus is down.
- Cargo: simple Cargo platform, DO NOT commit to this folder directly with compiled Cargo, but commit modified source code, In order to reduce size.
	I would do some change to this system using C++, but now there is nothing different with original Cargo.
- Document: put all the documents here, and try to avoid commit non-binary files.
