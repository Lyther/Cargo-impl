Y. Huang et al. Large Scale Real-time Ridesharing with Service Guarantee on
Road Networks. VLDB 2014

The original kinetic tree implementation can be found
[here](https://github.com/uakfdotb/tsharesim).

In this version, changes were made to integrate the original implementation
with the Cargo library and how Cargo defines certain ridesharing concepts.

TODO: detailed list maybe?
