### Additional

This directory only includes sol files, but without the whole dat output.
If you are looking forward detailed result, find them in my directory:
/home/andrea/Cargo/example/data/

Kinetic_tree is still running, last failure because of timeout.
trip_vehicle_grouping requires another file, I don't understand the error message of it, if you can find out why, please update the result of trip_vehicle_grouping.
